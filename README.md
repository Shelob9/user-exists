This is a WordPress plugin to check if a user exists on the site with Roy Sivan's email address.

GET `wp-json/hi-roy/roy` returns true if Roy is a user on your site, false if not. Also, Hi Roy.

This is an even less useful version of my plugin that gives an endpoint to [check if a user is registered by email](https://github.com/CalderaWP/user-exists).
